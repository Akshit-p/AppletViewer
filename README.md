# AppletViewer
Helps windows users to see java applets in html files.

## Instructions :

1) YOU NEED JAVA INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER.
2) Place the batch or the .exe file in the same place where the html is.
3) Open the appletViewer and then type the name of html you want to see the applet from(eg. applet1.html).

The appletViewer opens the HTML file in the default browser and the applet separately. Some HTML file may contain multiple applets and so it will open multiple applets in different window.
